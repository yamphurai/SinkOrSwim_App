Rubric Details:

  - use a mix of Swift and Objective-C in this assignment. At least one file should be objective-c
  - free reign to create an application that manages some type of mutable information. That means that the data displayed by the app is expected to change.
  - The data you load and display can come from anywhere and you can do whatever you want with it.
  - It can be whatever information you want to display (really, have fun with it), as long as you use the interface elements as described below.
  - Create an iOS application in XCode that uses the storyboard and a TableViewController to load different views based on the data your are loading.
  - The TableViewController must implement three different types of cells and load them dynamically (i.e., you cannot use a static table).
  - View navigation can be hierarchical in any way you want--as long as it makes sense for the interface and the data you are displaying.
  - When loading a new view controller your main view controller should hand off information to the controller that is getting created.

The application should make use of the following design elements in one or more of the views:
  1. Automatic Layout
  2. Buttons, Sliders, and Labels
  3. Stepper and Switch
  4. Picker (you must implement picker delegate)
  5. Segmented Control
  6. Timer (which should repeat and somehow update the UIView)
  7. ScrollView (with scrollable, zoomable content)
  8. Image View
  9. Navigation Controller
  10. Collection View Controller
  11. Table View Controller with three different dynamic prototype cells
  12. The design should work in both portrait and landscape mode
  13. I should not be able to crash your app
  14. Your design must strictly adhere to Model View Controller programming practices. Use lazy instantiation when possible


Exceptional Credit: Implement a modal view and handle properly using custom protocols/delegation

** Test your app running on the device, not the emulator to ensure it runs in all scenarios **

What to turn in: 
  1. The source code for your app via upload or github link (if uploading, call the file "teamNameAssignmentOne.zip").
  2. Your team member names and team name
  3. A video of your working app
